    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

Usage

Wale tries to adjust all sound generating processes' peak level to 'Target: yellow bar on View(F2) page' level. You can change Target to your preferred level.

However, Wale uses windows volume system for now, which means the app only can control volume between 0.0~1.0. Hence, if you set Target to near 1.0, then Wale could not control volume, because all processes' peak levels are always less than or equal to Target. So, you should lower Target a little. Suggested Target level is about 0.25(-6dB). Default is 0.15(-8dB).

    Caution! Too low Target may cause sudden hugely loud sound. Low Target means quieter output sound from your windows system. Then, you may need to increase the volume of your hardware such as speaker to hear the sound. In this situation, uncontrolled process would make very loud sound caused by some trouble of sound system include unintentional stop of Wale.

    Just click the session name or blue checkbox on that session to uncheck it if you want to exclude some session from auto control. This exclusion is not saved when Wale is closed.
    You can use your mouse wheel to adjust Relative volume -white bar- for each session. Relative value is not saved when Wale is closed.

Wale System Description
View(F2)
MASTER CONTROL - Left pane

Controls volume of current default render device with mouse wheel on anywhere of master tab. Control step is on small textbox which a left one of two of them.
Click ‘Set Volume’ button to set a volume of current default render device, target volume is on bigger textbox which a right one of two of them.
AlwaysTop(F7): window would be always on top
StayOn(F8): window does not close automatically
DetailView(F9): detailed mode for session pane
SESSION(APPLICATION) CONTROL - Right pane

Click checkbox or session name to include to or exclude from auto control list.
Click number to cycle values to volume, peak, average peak or relative volume when not detailed mode.
Use mouse wheel to change relative volume of each session.
Relative is kept between -1~1. And Final volume is multiplied by (2^Relative).
Config(F3)

    UI Update [ms]: update interval of main UI and audio status
    Auto Control [ms]: auto control interval, a value lower than 15ms is worthless due to the limitation of windows system
    GC Interval [ms]: garbage collection interval
    Target Level: target peak to equalization
    Up Rate: rate of volume raising per second
    Kurtosis: kurtosis for reciprocal functions
    Function:
    linear=V+(R-R*V)
    sliced linear=(V&lt;V_B)? V+A*V+R ∶ V+B*(V-1) [A=R-R/V_B][B=R*V_B/(V_B-1)]
    reciprocal=V+R*1/(K+(1-K)*V-1) [if (K==1&amp;&amp;V==0) reciprocal=99]
    fixed reciprocal=V+R*((K+(1-K)*V)^(1/(Log_2(K)))-1) [if (K==0) fixed reciprocal=input][if (K==1) fixed reciprocal=input+R]
    where V=Volume,R=UpRate,B=Base Volume,K=Kurtosis

    Graph: graph for current volume raising function, yellow is base, blue is current, red is new(you want to set)

    Average Time: past time to compute average
    Min Peak Level: minimum peak to compute average
    Average Enabled: On/Off average computing, should always on
    Auto Control Enabled: On/Off Auto Session(App) volume control, should always on

    Run at Windows Startup: run at windows start
    Detailed View: view mode for main window.
    Detailed Log: log more detailed information on file. for future
    Priority: process priority for Wale.

Log(F4)

you can find app log on log tab, detailed log on %appdata%\WaleAudioControl</value>
