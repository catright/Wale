# Wale
Windows Audio Loudness Equalizer

Wale calculates appropriate volume of each app in real time from app's average peak level and try to equalize peak levels of each app to desired level. You can configure several parameters such as action timing, period of average, volume recovery function, target peak level, and so on.

Wale is free open-source app, some sensitive AV could alert Wale as a virus, but this is false positive. If you got such alert, please report to your AV provider or open a new issue. Or, if you could not trust Wale, you should stop to use Wale immediately. You must run the app which you could trust for your security.

# Before use
### First
If you just want to control every apps manually, I recommend _EarTrumpet_ which is much more stable, fancy, and easy to use. I also using it more than several years. You can download it on Microsoft store.

The purpose of Wale is automatic control of system wide sound output.

### Second
If your sound card driver provides '_Loudness Equalization_' or its equivalent, please use it. Your driver is also much more reliable and easy to use. Many sound drivers support this feature these days. Most of them can be accessed by following way.

1. Open Sound setting panel. Fastest way is _**Run**(Win+R)_ `control mmsys.cpl sounds`
2. Double click to open your playback device.
3. Switch to _Enhancements_ tab.
4. Check _Loudness Equalization_.

Accessing method varies with sound card vendors. On-board sound card users also use this feature same way.
